Outlaw
===
Outlaw is a simplistic and lightweight gallery that toggles from a small view to a full screen view. It's also responsive and soon to be completely browser compatible.

View it live [here](http://dope.github.io/outlaw)

###Getting Started
Getting started couldn't be easier, first you need to link your stylesheet

```
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="css/outlaw.css">
```
The only changes you really need to make in the CSS file is the width of `.wrap` (you don't even need to use that to be honest.)

Next you need to link the `outlaw.js` file and link up [jQuery](http://jquery.com).

####Usage
To use Outlaw, just add the class `.imgSmall` to your images, for example:

```
<img class="imgSmall" src="img/example.jpg"/>
```


###Todo list
There is a lot of things I still want to do for Outlaw, so if you want to help out, I'd appreciate that very much.

- Make browser compatible
- Work on a wide range of devices
- Easily change size of image classes
